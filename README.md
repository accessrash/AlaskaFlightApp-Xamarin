# FlightApp-Xamarin
This is a flight app that is used to find the list of flights arriving at a given airport in the next 1 hour.
The list is displayed in a recycler view.
Tapping on one of the list item would show the details screen to view details of the selected flight.
Project also has some unit tests.
